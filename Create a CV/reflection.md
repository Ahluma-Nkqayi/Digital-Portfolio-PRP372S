**S:** As part of the work readiness training and digital portfolio requirements, I had to create and submit a professional CV showcasing my qualifications, skills, and project experience. This task was also linked to the career preparation module, where we were guided on how to structure and present a CV suitable for job or internship applications.
**T:** My task was to ensure that the CV I created met industry standards, was well-structured, updated, and clearly presented my academic journey, technical competencies, and real-world project involvement. Additionally, I needed to include the CV in my digital portfolio and submit it on Blackboard as part of the assessment.
**A:** I created a clean and professional CV using Microsoft Word. I ensured that it accurately highlighted my educational background, technical and soft skills, project experience, and certifications. I took the time to proofread and format the document for clarity, structure, and visual balance. Once I was satisfied with the final version, I submitted the CV. 
**R:** Although I have not yet uploaded the CV to GitHub, I have completed it and plan to include it in my digital portfolio before the final submission deadline. This process helped me reflect on how to professionally present myself to potential employers, and it improved my confidence in writing and refining my CV for future job applications.
