**S: **As part of the Work Readiness training, I completed the "Skills and Interests" module, which included quizzes to assess my understanding of different skill types, personal interests, and the role of values in career decision-making.
**T:** My task was to understand how my personal values, transferable skills, and interests can influence my career path. I also needed to reflect on these aspects to better align my future career choices with who I am and what I’m good at.
**A:** I engaged with the content and completed all the quizzes in the module. Although I answered one of the questions on transferable skills incorrectly at first, I reviewed the explanation and retook the quiz to improve my understanding. I learned about the differences between hard and soft skills, and how interests and values serve as important career drivers. I also reflected on my own interests in problem-solving, software development, and working with data.
**R:** By completing this task, I developed a clearer understanding of the unique combination of skills and interests I bring to the table. This helped me recognize the kind of roles I’m best suited for, such as software development, quality assurance, or frontend work. It also encouraged me to focus on building more transferable skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability, which are valuable across multiple roles in ICT.
