**S:** As part of the requirements for the Work Readiness Digital Portfolio, I was tasked with creating and submitting a professional CV that outlines my academic background, technical skills, and work-related experience.
**T:** I needed to ensure that my CV was clear, professional, and aligned with industry expectations. The goal was to submit it as part of my GitHub-based portfolio for evaluation and to be able to use it for future internship applications.
**A:** I created my CV using Microsoft Word, ensuring it covered my education, certifications, technical and soft skills, and the projects I’ve contributed to throughout my studies. I also reviewed templates and guidelines to make sure my layout and content were professional and relevant.
**R:** Although I haven’t uploaded the CV to GitHub yet, I have completed it and am in the process of finalizing and formatting it for submission. This exercise has helped me better understand how to structure a CV effectively and has prepared me to confidently present myself to potential employers in the near future.
