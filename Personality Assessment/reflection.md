**S:** As part of the work readiness program, I completed the Personality Assessment module. The goal of the module was to help me understand how my personality traits influence career choices and identify roles that suit my natural preferences.
**T:** I was required to complete quizzes that assessed my understanding of various personality types—such as Realistic, Artistic, Investigative, and Conventional—and how these types relate to suitable careers. The task also involved reflecting on how my own personality traits might guide my professional direction.
**A:** I worked through the entire module and answered all quiz questions. Although I initially got a few answers incorrect, I reviewed the material and learned more about personality-career alignment. I discovered that individuals like me—who enjoy working with systems, data, and structure—tend to align with Conventional and Investigative roles. I recognized my strength in analytical thinking and preference for organized environments, which are well-suited for careers in software development, data analysis, or quality assurance.
**R:** The evaluation provided me with a better insight into how my character aligns with the ICT sector. It strengthened my desire for technical positions that demand logical thinking, organization, and problem resolution. Consequently, I now possess a clearer understanding of the types of positions I would excel in and can adjust my career planning to match.
